## Usage

You can use `someguy` as a client, or as a server.

### Server

You can start the server with `someguy start`. This will, by default, run a Delegated Routing V1 server that proxies requests to the [IPFS Amino DHT](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-09-amino-refactoring/) and the [cid.contact](https://cid.contact) indexer (IPNI) node.

For more details run `someguy start --help`.

### Client

If you don't want to run a server yourself, but want to query some other server, you can run `someguy ask` and choose any of the subcommands and ask for a provider, a peer, or even an IPNS record.

For more details run `someguy ask --help`.

## Deployment

Suggested method for self-hosting is to run a [prebuilt Docker image](#docker).

## Release

To make a release, create a new PR that updates the [`version.json`](./version.json) file. This PR should not include any other changes besides the version bump. A new release will be automatically made once the PR is merged
